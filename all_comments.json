I&#39;ve been scraping for a little while now using beautifulSoup , selenium and puppeteer, but I&#39;m new to scrapy. Your explanations are very clear and easy to follow. One thing about this video, I guess <a href=\"http://nfl.com/\">NFL.com</a> has changed their site since this video was made, so none of the urls will work. I still followed along anyway, because I liked the way you approached the problem.",

I checked my code by rewatching the video and I even added the &quot;AUTOTHROTTLE_ENABLED = True&quot; variable, however, my code still isn&#39;t scraping that many reviews. Would you know what possibly could have caused this?",

    "Comment: Great tutorial, these videos are valuable! I have a question that relates to my day-to-day work, and I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve covered this in past videos. <br><br>Essentially, I&#39;m trying to automate the process of logging in to a payment gateway site (DLocal) and downloading financial statements.<br>1. With Selenium, only a blank page is returned when going to the login page --&gt;&gt; which makes me think there&#39;s some sort of anti-bot measure in place. Other sites like AMEX gave me no problems.<br>2. Since the entire page is rendered from JS, requests, requests-html, BS4 didn&#39;t yield much better results. The render() method from requests-html didn&#39;t work since only a blank page (empty HTML body) is returned -&gt;&gt; circles back to the antibot idea. Without the recaptcha token generated from the JS script, I can&#39;t make a POST request to authenticate.<br><br>I&#39;m fairly new to this whole scraping thing, so I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s any sort of workaround from your experience? Or if it&#39;s even feasible/recommended? Thanks in advance!",

I&#39;m trying to write a concurrent project with Scrapy and want some advice on if CrawlerProcess is concurrent with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor? Is it better to write CrawlerProcess in separate spiders files (where each will have to initiate &#39;import CrawlerProcess&#39;) and be called from a <a href=\"http://main.py/\">main.py</a> file with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor? To be more precise will CrawlerProcess overlap each other and not being concurrent if multiple CrawerProcess() calls are being made from the same file (and possibly asynchroneous instead of concurrent) even with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor? Thanks.",

However I do not just get the title and price from first page. Instead of that, what I do is to extract first 40 items with their links and then send another call  with (SplashReuqest) (meaning I create second parse function) and define the items I want to extract. However it fails each time and only extract 5 to 8 items out of 40. Could you please let me know if there is any way to get all the items?",

    "Comment: hm sadly Scrapy is single-threaded and Selenium is blocking if its called within a Spider, so the Spiders will not execute concurrently then (if they use Selenium instead of requests, to resolve an url). I wonder how it is possible to crawl that fast with Scrapy while also using Selenium for HTML-Rendering. Great video btw!",
